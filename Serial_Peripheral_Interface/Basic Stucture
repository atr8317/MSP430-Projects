A is Master
B is Slave

A chooses number
  - when number chosen, start == 1
A sends start to B; B sends guess to A
A sends comparison to B; B sends next guess to A
  - continue until number is guessed
    - comparison value will determine whether game_over flag is asserted
      - comparison == 0 -> no comparison sent
      - comparison == 1 -> guess < number
      - comparison == 2 -> guess > number
      - comparison == 4 -> guess == number
          - game_over == 1

When game_over == 1
  - reset start, compare, and game_over to 0


Set-Up
  Transmission Set 1
    - A (Master)
      - tx start
      - rx guess
    - B (Slave)
      - tx guess
      - rx start
      
  Transmission Set 2 - to be repeated until game is over
    - A (Master)
      - tx compare
      - rx guess
    - B (Slave)
      - tx guess
      - rx compare
      
Master only ever needs to send one byte per transmission set, so the value is sent twice to allow the Slave to sent 2 bytes
